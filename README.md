# botany

A hacked client for a game called botany, where you water and nurture a plant.

Current hacks:
 - Set your score in the game to 9000

Original game by Jake Funke - jifunks@gmail.com - tilde.town/~curiouser - http://jakefunke.online/

Original README is as follows:

"A command line, realtime, community plant buddy.

You've been given a seed that will grow into a beautiful plant.
Check in and water your plant every 24h to keep it growing. 5 days without water = death. Your plant depends on you to live!

*(work in progress)*

## getting started
botany is designed for unix-based systems. Clone into a local directory using `$ git clone https://github.com/jifunks/botany.git`.

Run with `$ python botany.py`.

*Note - botany.py must initially be run by the user who cloned/unzipped
botany.py - this initalizes the shared data file permissions.*

Water your seed to get started. You can come and go as you please and your plant continues to grow.

Make sure to come back and water every 24 hours or your plant won't grow.

If your plant goes 5 days without water, it will die!


## features
* Curses-based menu system, optimized for 80x24 terminal
* ASCII art display of plant
* Persistent aging system that allows your plant to grow even when app is closed
* Community leaderboard (for shared unix servers) created in program directory `garden_file.json`
* Data file is created in the user's home (~) directory, along with a JSON file that can be used in other apps.

```

"score":1730,
"owner":"jakefunke",
"is_dead":false,
"last_watered":1489113197
}
```

### testing features
* ASCII art only shows first stage of growth - more coming soon!

### to-dos
* Add day/night ASCII art
* Finish garden display ('garden' function)
 * Allows you to water neighbor's plants
* Plant end of life (seeding/pollination)
 * Plant pollination - cross-breed with neighbor plants to unlock second-gen plants
* Global events
 * Server API to have rain storms, heat waves, insects
* Name your plant
* Reward for keeping plant alive
  * Hybridization, multiple generations, lineage tracking

## requirements
* Unix-based OS (Mac, Linux)
* Python 2.x
* Recommended: 80x24 minimum terminal, fixed-width font

## credits
* thank you tilde.town for inspiration!
